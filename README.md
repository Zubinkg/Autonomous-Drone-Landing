GPS technology is used by many quadcopters to determine their position. However, it is only precise on the meter scale, limiting a quadcopterâ€™s ability for higher precision navigation and autonomous landing. As a result, an additional positioning system is necessary for a quadcopter to land accurately.

This project explores the use of a visionless sensor system and landmark-based localization to autonomously land a quadcopter accurately in the center of a predefined landing site. This approach is less computationally intensive than computer vision- based systems and can work regardless of lighting conditions.

The nano-quadcopter used in this project has six infrared laser distance sensors that are used for localization through detection of the landing pad markers. This method resulted in successful landings in the landing site 83% of the time (including crashes), with only few failures that can be attributed to the instability of the nano-quadcopter. These results suggest that with more testing on larger quadcopters, a visionless landing localization system similar to that of this project could prove to be an accurate and reliable alternative to computer vision-based quadcopter localization.
